# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Allows registered users to create and share shortened links to anyone.

## Features

Users that register an account can create and share links. Every link they create becomes visible in a table where they can view the shortened URL, long URL, date it was created, and number of page visits. They also have the ability to modify and delete individual links.
